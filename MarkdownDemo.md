# The Best Document

This is a Markdown document which seems like a very simple language, not sure if it's a programming language because I haven't seen anything that makes it turing complete or not.

Text can be used in a variety of ways such as being *italicized* or in strong **bold** letters.

There isn't a lot of coding and this is arguably easier to use than HTML. Sometimes being easy isn't bad though. It can:

- Make you feel pretty good
- remove some extra stress from your daily life
- prevents heartburn or something I don't know this isn't a health product commercial

You're a busy person and here's some links to very important places you want to visit
